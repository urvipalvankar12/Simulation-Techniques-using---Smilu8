Call Centre Analytics Problem solved using simulations generated by Simul8 Software
Suppose that the interarrival time of customer calls is exponentially distributed with mean 1 minute.
For service times and flow percentages, use your findings from Question 1. Build a Simul8 model to
analyze the case of call centre. How much time do customers spend in the system, on average?
